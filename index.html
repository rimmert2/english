    <h1>The Effect of Cars on Crime</h1>

    <p>Recently in class, we watched <em>Train Wreck: The Real Project X</em> directed by Alex Wood on Netflix. This inspired me to investigate a current social issue that affects us all. I decided to explore how cars influence crime because I’m personally interested in vehicles and believe they have a significant impact. My hypothesis is that the widespread availability of personal motor vehicles has increased overall crime rates over the past fifty years. To test this, I’m focusing on three main questions: 1) Have car emissions affected crime rates and intelligence? 2) Has the use of cars as getaway vehicles made crime more effective? 3) What new crimes have emerged from the introduction of personal vehicles?</p>

    <p>Evidence suggests that emissions from cars—particularly those containing lead—have had a long-term effect on both intelligence and crime rates. Researchers discovered that exposure to leaded petrol in childhood is strongly linked to lower IQ and a greater likelihood of committing crimes later in life. This shows how the widespread use of cars indirectly contributed to higher crime rates. Even small increases in blood-lead levels can harm brain development and reduce impulse control. When countries phased out leaded fuel, both average IQ and crime rates improved within a generation. Although some argue that economic and social factors played a role, the consistent data across multiple studies supports the conclusion that car pollution, especially from lead, played a measurable role in intelligence and crime. This evidence supports my hypothesis that the rise of personal vehicles has increased crime overall.</p>


    <p>Cars have not only influenced crime indirectly through pollution but have also enabled new forms of criminal activity. Access to private vehicles has made it easier for offenders to flee crime scenes quickly, making arrests more difficult. This suggests that the mobility cars provide has changed both the nature and execution of crimes. These issues have existed for decades, which coincides with the growth in personal vehicle ownership. This demonstrates that cars have made certain crimes more efficient and harder to prevent, supporting the idea that the spread of cars has contributed to rising crime rates.</p>

    <p>The introduction of personal vehicles has also led to the development of entirely new types of crime. Offenders often use cars to carry out burglaries, making vehicles not just tools for escape but essential parts of the crime itself. A modern example of this is the rise in ram raids, which rely on cars to smash into buildings. There has been a sharp increase in ram-raid insurance claims over the past few years. Alarmingly, Auckland and the Bay of Plenty have recorded the most burglary-related claims, bringing the issue close to home. While some argue that cars have had positive effects through economic growth and accessibility, the evidence shows that they have also enabled new forms of crime, again supporting my hypothesis.</p>

    <p>Overall, research shows that personal motor vehicles have had a major influence on crime. Car emissions—especially from lead—have reduced intelligence and self-control, likely increasing violent crime. Cars have also made it easier for offenders to escape and created new forms of criminal activity like ram raids. Although vehicles have benefited society in many ways, the evidence suggests that they have also made crime more effective, supporting the hypothesis that the spread of personal cars has increased overall crime rates during the past fifty years.</p>
